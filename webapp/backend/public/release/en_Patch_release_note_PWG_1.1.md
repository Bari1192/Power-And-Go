# Release Notes - PowerAndGo System Update

## Major System Improvements

### New Service Implementation - CarRefreshService

We have introduced a new service class to manage vehicle state updates and monitoring. The CarRefreshService provides the following key functionalities:

- Real-time monitoring and updating of vehicle charging levels
- Dynamic adjustment of estimated driving range based on current battery status
- Implementation of category-specific minimum charging requirements
- Automated status updates for vehicles requiring maintenance or charging
- Integration with the charging penalty system for vehicles returned below minimum charge levels

### Enhanced Validation Rules

Several new validation rules have been implemented to ensure data integrity and business logic compliance:

1. TenYearsDifferenceInDrivingLicense
   - Ensures driving licenses maintain exactly 10 years validity period
   - Validates license start and end dates automatically
   - Implements strict date format checking

2. EmployeeFieldSelect
   - Validates employee department assignments
   - Ensures consistency in organizational structure
   - Maintains standardized field naming conventions

3. EmployeeRoleField
   - Validates employee role assignments based on their field
   - Implements hierarchical role validation
   - Ensures proper role-field relationships

## Major Code Restructuring

### Rental History System Reorganization

The rental history system has been restructured for improved modularity and maintenance. The original RenthistoryFactory has been divided into three specialized components:

1. RenthistoryFactory
   - Manages core rental record creation
   - Handles rental duration calculations
   - Processes basic rental information
   - Integrates with billing and user systems

2. CarUserParkingFactory
   - Dedicated to parking event management
   - Handles parking fee calculations
   - Manages parking time slots
   - Implements special parking rates for different time periods

3. CarUserChargeFactory
   - Manages vehicle charging events
   - Calculates charging costs and credits
   - Monitors charging durations
   - Handles charging station interactions

### Database Structure Updates

The database structure has been updated to reflect the new modular approach:
- New tables created for parking and charging events
- Improved relationship management between components
- Enhanced data integrity constraints
- Optimized query performance for rental history

## System Benefits

These improvements deliver several key benefits:

1. Enhanced System Reliability
   - Improved data consistency through specialized validation rules
   - Better error handling and system state management
   - More reliable vehicle status tracking

2. Improved Maintainability
   - Clearer separation of concerns in code structure
   - More focused and specialized components
   - Easier debugging and testing capabilities

3. Better User Experience
   - More accurate vehicle status information
   - Faster response times for rental operations
   - More reliable charging and parking management

## Technical Documentation

Detailed technical documentation for these changes has been added to the project wiki, including:
- Complete API specifications
- Updated database schemas
- New component interaction diagrams
- Updated testing procedures
